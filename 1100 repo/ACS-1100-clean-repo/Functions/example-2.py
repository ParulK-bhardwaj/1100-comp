#TODO: Take a look at your custom calculator. Ask yourself where you
#can add a function? 
#
# You should be able to add a function that performs
# the custom calculation.
# 
# It's also possible that your code could be broken into more than one function
# Think carefully about each of the functions you might create. They should each 
# be responsible for one task or operation. 
# 
# Make these changes.
